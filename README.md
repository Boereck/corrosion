## Installation
Refer to our [Installation Guide](documentation/Installation.md)

## Prerequisites

The Rustup and Cargo commands are required for accessing the language server and performing most tasks. Go into the Rust preferences and either install the commands or input their paths if not automatically found.

## Contributing
[Issue reports](https://github.com/LucasBullen/redOx/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/LucasBullen/redOx/pulls) are always appreciated.

For setting up RedOx for testing and development follow the [Using Github Installation Instructions](documentation/Installation.md#using-github)

The p2 repository is not kept up to date with the master branch. Releases to the p2 repository will be made in more controlled released after the initial release of RedOx v1.

## Concept

RedOx uses the [lsp4e](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.lsp4e) project to integrate with the [Rust Language Server](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rls) and [TM4E](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.tm4e) project to provide syntax highlighting in order to provide a rich Rust editor in the Eclipse IDE.
