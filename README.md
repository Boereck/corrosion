# RedOx
Support for Rust editing in Eclipse IDE.

RedOx (short for reductionâ€“oxidation, the reaction that causes rust), is a Rust development plugin for the Eclipse IDE. In its very alpha stages, RedOx is __NOT__ recommended for use at this time.

## Concept

RedOx uses the [lsp4e](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.lsp4e) project to integrate with the [Rust Language Server](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rls) and [TM4E](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.tm4e) project to provide syntax highlighting in order to provide a rich Rust editor in the Eclipse IDE.
